## Overview

Deep Learning is the future of machine learning...Let's get ready! This repo stores my projects for the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree, which is a GREAT program that combines theoretical knowledge with hands on practice through a holistically designed curriculum. Although Udacity calls it "Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations", this is by no means basics only! In-depth learning everywhere...

## To Fellow Udacians

It's a great choice you made choosing Udacity! Just like me :-) Feel free to get inspiration here for your own projects. However, please do not copy and paste, since the most important thing is your understanding of the material and your own ability to tackle different problems, which cannot be achieved by simply using borrowed code. 

Also, note that one unique value that Udacity offers is the learning process/experience through hands-on projects, which is really what makes learning very effective and efficient. Therefore, do things on your own best serves your interest, but not copying and pasting to only get the credentials - that's not the most valuable thing Udacity offers. Best of luck with your study and stay Udacious! Don't forget to connect with me on LinkedIn to stay in touch :-)
